## CLING - purposeful connections


**Problem**: We love to talk, we are social animals. 
The problem is that due to lack of trust and/or communication skills, fear, 
variety and sensitivity of specific topics and other reasons we are unaware of possible 
situations to have purposeful connection, even with the closest people surrounding us.

**Solution**:

Cling shows you interesting and trustful people nearby 
you and will give you attractive topic to talk with that person. 
You jump directly to purposeful talk.

Average person interact during his/her lifetime with around 80000 people.
Imagine how many of them could give you opportunity to make your dreams come 
true if you could talk with them about THE TOPIC which you had in COMMON,
but didn´t know. You could have life changing conversations every day. 
In the train, on the bus stop, café, even in the elevator, 
because Cling works decentralized without internet, giving you the freedom of data security, 
not sharing any of your sensitive topics you would like to share with somebody special. 
Life if full of interesting people. Discover them clinging.
